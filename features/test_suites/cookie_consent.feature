Feature: Cookie Consent Management

  As a user visiting the ING Poland website
  I want to customize cookie settings and enable analytical cookies
  So that my preferences are respected and stored in the browser

  Scenario: Accept analytical cookies via the cookie consent modal
    Given I open the ING homepage
    # And   Cookie consent modal is displayed
    # When  I customize cookie settings to enable analytical cookies
    # And   I save my cookie preferences
    # Then  Cookie consent modal should disappear
    # And   Analytical cookies should be stored in the browser
